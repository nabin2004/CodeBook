# CodeBook

**CodeBook** is a git-enabled note-taking application currently under development. The goal of this project is to create a robust, feature-rich note-taking app that integrates seamlessly with Git, allowing users to save and manage their notes directly on their personal GitHub accounts.

## Project Status

This project is in the exploratory and development phase. The codebase is still evolving, and the file structure is not yet fully organized. 

## Vision

The vision for CodeBook is to provide users with a powerful, open-source note-taking tool that leverages the best components from existing open-source projects, while offering unique integration with Git for version control and cloud storage.

## Components and Tools

### 1. **Joplin Integration**
   - After researching various open-source note-taking solutions, I discovered [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/), a popular, open-source note-taking app. 
   - I plan to integrate Joplin's note-editor component, which is located in the `editor` directory of the Joplin project, into CodeBook. This component is crucial for enabling rich text and Markdown editing capabilities.

### 2. **Git Integration**
   - CodeBook will feature seamless integration with Git, allowing users to save, commit, and push their notes to their personal GitHub accounts. This ensures that notes are version-controlled and easily accessible from anywhere.

## Current Focus

- **Exploration and Feasibility**: I am currently focused on figuring out how to extract and adapt the Joplin note-editor component for use in CodeBook. This includes understanding dependencies, setting up the editor in a standalone environment, and integrating it with the Git features I plan to implement.

## Future Goals

- **Complete the Integration of Joplin's Editor**: Successfully incorporate the Joplin note-editor into CodeBook, ensuring full Markdown and rich text support.
- **Implement Git Operations**: Develop functionalities that allow users to save, commit, and push notes to GitHub.
- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface that makes note-taking intuitive and enjoyable.
- **Documentation**: As the project progresses, I will continue to improve this README and other documentation to help contributors and users understand the system.
